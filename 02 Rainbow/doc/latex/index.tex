\subsection*{Goal}

The objective of this homework is to implement an attack on password tables with a rainbow table with a success rate of 75\%.

\subsection*{Structure}

Build files are in folder {\ttfamily build}.

Source files are in folder {\ttfamily src}. You can find 3 subfolders, one to \hyperlink{namespacebe_1_1esi_1_1secl_1_1pn_af8b773cad93b0eb78b89f69721e4bb1d}{generate the Rainbow Table}, one to do the \hyperlink{namespacebe_1_1esi_1_1secl_1_1pn_aad832fb30fa4cc9e74d15d7129d0c929}{Rainbow Attack}, and some utils.

{\ttfamily rsc} will contain the rainbow table, the cracked passwords and the cracked passwords hashes.

You can find the documentation of the project into the {\ttfamily doc} folder.

\subsection*{How to}

To set up the project and launch it with default values, use command {\ttfamily make}. It will \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item install or update {\ttfamily sqlite}, {\ttfamily libsqlite3-\/dev}, {\ttfamily gcc-\/8} and {\ttfamily g++-\/8},
\item build the project,
\item launch the project (generate the RT and crack some hashes).
\end{DoxyItemize}

To set up the project and launch it \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item install or update sqlite and gcc/g++ (wich are require) with command {\ttfamily make setup},
\item build the project with command {\ttfamily make build}.
\item generate the rainbow table with command {\ttfamily build/generate\+RT number\+Of\+Head number\+Of\+Reduce},
\item generate the rainbow table with command {\ttfamily build/crack\+RT}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Important note}

The constraints of the homework are \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item passwords of length 6 to 8,
\item alphanumeric passwords,
\item 75\% success rate,
\item size of RT 12\+Gib or lower,
\item 50.\+000 reduces (indicated in the course),
\item the hashes to crack are probably generated with rainbow\+:\+:mass\+\_\+generate, which mean there is 33\% of chance to get a password of size 6, 7 or 8.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The util to generate the passwords, provided by the teachers, generate alphanumerical passwords, lower and uppercase. The point is that we can\textquotesingle{}t build a table smaller than 12\+Gib which reach 75\% success rate. Here is why \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item each row take at least {\ttfamily 8$\ast$2 = 16} byte (at least because the DB hold some informations),
\item an 12\+Gib table can hold {\ttfamily 12.\+884.\+901.\+888/16 = 805.\+306.\+368} rows,
\item with 805.\+306.\+368 rows, 50.\+000 reduce, a password of lenght 8, and 62 possible values for each char of the password, you can expect a success rate lower than 20\% (according to the formula 3, page 6, of \href{https://lasecwww.epfl.ch/pub/lasec/doc/Oech03.pdf}{\tt this work}),
\item but we need at least 25\% of success to get 75\% of global success ({\ttfamily (100+100+25)/3})
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
Due to these problems, we decided to work with the same constraints, except for the alphanumerical password. We will use alphanumerical {\bfseries lower case} password only \end{quote}
