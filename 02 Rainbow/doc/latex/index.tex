\subsection*{Goal}

Implement a rainbow attack with a success rate of 75\% for alphanumeric passwords of length\mbox{[}6-\/8\mbox{]}.

\subsection*{Structure}

Build files are in folder {\ttfamily build}.

Source files are in folder {\ttfamily src}. You can find 3 subfolders, one to \hyperlink{namespacebe_1_1esi_1_1secl_1_1pn_abd22f0fb1b69636d22a3f698f3683085}{generate the Rainbow Table}, one to do the \hyperlink{namespacebe_1_1esi_1_1secl_1_1pn_a56fa00c405a4fb0e6446717fb1390493}{Rainbow Attack}, and some utils.

{\ttfamily rsc} will contain the rainbow table, the cracked passwords and the cracked passwords hashes.

You can find the documentation of the project into the {\ttfamily doc} folder.

\subsection*{How to}

To set up the project and launch it with default values, use command {\ttfamily make}. It will \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item install or update {\ttfamily sqlite} and {\ttfamily libsqlite3-\/dev},
\item build the project,
\item launch the project (generate the RT and crack some hashes).
\end{DoxyItemize}

To set up the project and launch it with custom values\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item install or update sqlite (wich is require) with command {\ttfamily make setup},
\item build the project with command {\ttfamily make build}.
\item generate the rainbow table with command {\ttfamily build/generate\+RT number\+Of\+Line number\+Of\+Reduce passwords\+Size},
\item crack the rainbow table with command {\ttfamily build/crack\+RT number\+Of\+Reduce passwords\+Size}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

You can find the cracked passwords with their hashes into {\ttfamily rsc/cracked\+Pwd.\+txt} and {\ttfamily rsc/cracked\+Hash.\+txt}. Each line of the second file is the hash of the first file from the same line. Each empty line from the first file is an uncracked password.

\begin{quote}
Note that the real number of lines is lower than the one given in parameter. \end{quote}
We ignore the generated line if it has the same head or tail than a previous line. Therefore, the first lines are generated quickly, but the last lines could take hours to generate. To avoid the program running for days, we attempt to generate number\+Of\+Lines different lines, then stop.

\subsection*{Know bugs}

There are no bugs! We are perfect!
