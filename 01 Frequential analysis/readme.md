# Frequential analysis #
## Project description ##
Ciphers, deciphers and solve a text using the Vigenere algo.
This application is impemented with the index of co√Øncidence and the chi square test. Because of that, solving some small text can sometimes fail (try to solve file _./exemple/breakTheSolver.txt_. The key valid key is _CIPHERS_). To avoid this problem, a good way is to use the _local random search_ (which is not used here).
## How to build ##
Run the makefile from the root directory.
- _make_ to build into _./build_ the project and launch a demo.
- _make build_ to build only.
- _make clean_ to clean the _./build_ directory
## How to use ##
- To ciphers, run the program with arguments : _-c in out key_
  - _-c_ tell to the programm to ciphers.
  - _in_ is the input file. The alphabetical values must be coded same as ASCII.
  - _out_ is the output file.
  - _key_ is the key to cipher. The key is set upper case, and all non alphabetical letters are dropped.
- To deciphers, run the program with argumets : _-d in out key_
  - _-d_ tell to the programm to deciphers.
  - _in_ is the input file. The alphabetical values must be coded same as ASCII. All caracters must be upper case, between A and Z.
  - _out_ is the output file. The output is upper case.
  - _key_ is the key to decipher. The key is set upper case, and all non alphabetical letters are dropped.
- To solve a ciphered message, use the program with arguments  _-s in out_
  - _-s_ tell to the programm to deciphers without the key.
  - _in_ is the input file. All caracters must be upper case, between A and Z. The alphabetical values must be coded same as ASCII. The text is supposed to be English
  - _out_ is the output file. The output is upper case.
