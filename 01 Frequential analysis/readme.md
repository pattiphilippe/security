# Frequential analysis #
## How to build ##
Run the makefile from the root directory.
## How to use ##
- To ciphers, run the program with arguments : _-c in out key_
  - _-c_ tell to the programm to ciphers.
  - _in_ is the input file. The file must be ASCII.
  - _out_ is the output file.
  - _key_ is the key to cipher.
- To deciphers, run the program with argumets : _-d in out key_
  - _-d_ tell to the programm to deciphers.
  - _in_ is the input file. The file must be ASCII. All caracters must be upper case, between A and Z.
  - _out_ is the output file. The output is upper case.
  - _key_ is the key to decipher.
- To solve a ciphered message, use the program with arguments  _-s in out_
  - _-s_ tell to the programm to deciphers without the key.
  - _in_ is the input file. The file must be ASCII. All caracters must be upper case, between A and Z.
  - _out_ is the output file. The output is upper case.
